# PBSuite

PBJelly is a highly automated pipeline that aligns long sequencing reads (such as PacBio RS reads or long 454 reads in fasta format) to high-confidence draft assembles. PBJelly fills or reduces as many captured gaps as possible to produce upgraded draft genomes. Each step in PBJellyâ€™s workflow can be run on a cluster, thus parallelizing the gap filling process for rapid turn around, even for very large eukaryotic genomes.
